# Salario-minimo-Venezuela
The mockery of this government against the people does not seem to end, on June 20 decided to make an increase to the minimum wage that could be called derision or degradation for most people who live or depend heavily on this salary . And it is that in Venezuela when the salary is increased we are not satisfied, because as this rises, the price of absolutely everything rises, so that the purchasing power is still an absurdity, complicating even more the access to food and medicines, and increasing and inflating inflation rates that already exist and escape the imagination of many, placing Venezuela in the inflation stratosphere. He who calls himself president of Venezuela, only harms the country every time he opens his mouth, raising the salary in the order of 5,000,000bsf that is equivalent to less than $ 2, and that is not even an egg carton can be purchased In many places with this money, Venezuela is bleeding, and I am afraid of how sleepy the town is, which seems normal and how you are doing, to which you are accustomed to live in a country where no price keeps, makes Little did I think we had already hit bottom, but the truth is that no, everything can always be worse. It draws my attention immensely as it seems not to wake the people, and is that although I said in previous publications, we are going through a numbness and psychological indoctrination, Venezuelans no longer think about more than covering basic needs with great effort, money that It is possible to move in this dictatorship through remittances from relatives who are abroad and somehow try to help their loved ones, but even many product prices are hyper-inflated, and have prices that even in other countries is absurd, adding to the pathetic purchasing power of the Venezuelan we have devoted ourselves to observing shelves, we have dedicated ourselves to dreaming about that country that existed, I believe that it is time to wake up from that dream, and make Venezuela to be again that was and is even better, I think it's time to change the jokes that are making us, I think the economic defalco Nicolas Maduro has given the op ortunidad of social outbursts, but the doctrine through food and medicine that have imposed us has us thinking about other things, for me the time is approaching, and I pray because so be it, nothing can be maintained with a system that keeps citizens in a constant search for food, I wonder how many more people should die from malnutrition? , because the streets are full of this, of HUNGER.  Finally, I look forward to the day when I will see what the final destiny of Nicolas Maduro and those who follow him is. I dream of the Venezuela of before and I dream of the day when justice will exist again and make all of them pay. that a lot of ashes returned to Venezuela, those that took the oil country to the bankruptcy and those that have violated so many human rights to thousands of Venezuelans, I pray that the genocides obtain the appropriate punishment.
